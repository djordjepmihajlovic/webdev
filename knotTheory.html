    <h1 class="learn">What's a knot?</h1>
    <p> A knot is a 3D loop (like a rubber band). However, these loops can get tangled to points of no return! Below we have two different knots, can you untangle the knot on the right to look like the one on the left without breaking the loop?</p>
    <div class="knots">
        <img src="img/unknot_gray.png" alt="unknot"/>
        <img src="img/trefoil_gray.png" alt="trefoil knot"/>
    </div>
    <p> The answer is no! These two knots are different and cannot be deformed to look like each other. In fact there are plenty of knots that cannot be deformed to look like others. Here are a few examples.</p>
    <div class="knots">
        <img src="img/first5gray.png" alt="5 knots"/>
    <p> These are known as prime knots.</p>

    <h1>Knots can look different</h1>
    <p> We can alter how a knot looks by stretching, squeezing, or twisting it, so long as the loop doesn't break.</p>

    <h1>So how can you tell two different types of knot apart, or which knot is which?</h1>
    <p> This is where knot theory comes in! Knot theory is a branch of mathematics that studies knots.</p>
    <p> Mathematicians have introduced many different measures for discerning between knots, these are known as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_invariant%23:~:text%3DA%2520knot%2520invariant%2520is%2520a%2520quantity%2520defined%2520on%2520the%2520set,quantity%2520defined%2520on%2520knot%2520diagrams.&ved=2ahUKEwi855CBlpeFAxVHXEEAHVJsCk8QFnoECBgQAw&usg=AOvVaw3xkqJoiHzPzJ61fZSswUzO">knot invariants</a>.</p>
    <p>Physicists have particular interest in knots and knot invariants as they come up in a variety of places, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkmQNbvlK8s">DNA</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVt_OZhE5KA">Quantum mechanics</a>.</p>
    <p> The problem is that there is no known knot invariant that can uniquely describe every knot.</p>
