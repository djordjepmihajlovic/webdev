    <h1 class="learn">The Project</h1>
    <p> So as we've seen from playing <button onclick="SpotaKnotGamePage()" class="custom-button-2"> Spot a Knot </button> and reading through <button onclick="KnotTheoryPage()" class="custom-button-2">An Intro to Knot Theory</button>, it is not always easy to tell two knots apart.</p>
    <p> This project builds on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11722">previous work</a>, where it was shown that using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a> methods, some knot measurements allowed for accurate classification of knots!</p>

    <h1>The Features</h1>
    <p> In particular, the measurements which lead to highly accurate classification consider how "entangled" every part of the knot is.</p>
    <p> Below is an example of high entanglement versus low entanglement for segments of a knot.</p>

    <h1>Hidden knot invariants</h1>
    <p> As the machine learning methods are able to accurately classify knots, the project at hand asked whether or not there is hidden information within these "segment entanglement" measurements.</p>
    <p> In particular, are there any hidden knot invariants?</p>
    <p> This is investigated using machine learning and a host of knot theory mathematics, with surprising results linking our measures of entanglement to knots with points of singularity.</p>
